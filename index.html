          <p>The goal of this project was to make use of a persistant database using Firebase and Angularfire for Angular 2. The app has full CRUD functionality, and a password protected admin backend to manage the team. Non-admin users are able to view the full team roster, and click on each member to see more information about that particular player through the use of dynamic routing.</p>
